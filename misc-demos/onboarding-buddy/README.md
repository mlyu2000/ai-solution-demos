## 🔄 Proxy Architecture & CORS Handling

The application implements a sophisticated proxy architecture to handle CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) challenges when communicating with external LLM services. This architecture ensures secure and flexible API communication while maintaining compatibility with various deployment environments.

### Why CORS is a Challenge
**CORS** (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a browser security feature that restricts web applications from making requests to a different origin (domain/protocol/port) than the one that served the web page. Even when running on the same PCAI cluster and domain, browser-enforced CORS policies can block requests to LLM endpoints.

### Architecture Overview

1. **Frontend Layer (Vite Dev Server / Nginx)**
   - Serves the React application to end users
   - In development, Vite's built-in proxy handles API requests
   - In production, Nginx serves static files and proxies API requests

2. **API Proxy Layer**
   - **Development**: Vite proxies requests from `/api` to a local Node.js proxy server (port 3001)
   - **Production**: Nginx serves static files and routes API requests to the Node.js middleware service
   - Handles CORS headers and request/response transformation

### Implementation Details

#### Development Mode (Vite Proxy)
- The Vite dev server proxies `/api` requests to an LLM endpoint defined by the `VITE_PROXY_URL` environment variable
- The proxy rewrites the `Origin` header to match the target LLM's origin, making requests appear same-origin
- Configured in `vite.config.ts`

#### Production Mode (Nginx + Node.js Middleware)
- Nginx serves static files and proxies `/api` requests to the Node.js middleware
- The Node.js middleware (`scripts/proxy.mjs`) handles:
  - Dynamic extraction of target LLM hostname/path
  - Header rewriting for CORS compliance
  - Request/response transformation
  - Preflight `OPTIONS` request handling
  - API key authentication
  - Request logging

### Why Node.js Middleware is Essential
- Acts as a server-side proxy to avoid browser CORS restrictions
- Enables dynamic LLM endpoint configuration at runtime
- Provides request/response transformation between frontend and LLM APIs
- Handles authentication and security headers
- Implements rate limiting and request validation
- Provides detailed logging for debugging

### Frontend Integration
- The `callLLM` utility in `src/utils/aiUtils.ts` constructs the correct proxy URL based on environment
- Automatically detects development vs. production mode
- Handles both direct and proxied API calls seamlessly

## 🖥️ Installation Methods

### 🏠 Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/onboarding-buddy.git
   cd onboarding-buddy
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Configure the proxy URL (only needed for development):
     ```env
     # Development Proxy Configuration
     VITE_PROXY_URL=http://localhost:3001
     ```

4. Start the development servers:
   ```sh
   # Start the frontend
   npm run dev
   
   # In a separate terminal, start the proxy server
   node scripts/proxy.mjs
   ```

5. Access the application at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

### 🏗️ Building for Production

To build and preview the application in a production-like environment:

1. Build the production assets:
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```
   This creates an optimized production build in the `dist` directory.

2. Preview the production build locally:
   ```sh
   npm run preview
   ```
   This serves the built application on [http://localhost:4173](http://localhost:4173) by default.

3. (Optional) To test with the proxy in production mode:
   - First, build the application as shown above
   - Then run the proxy server in a separate terminal:
     ```sh
     node scripts/proxy.mjs
     ```
   - Access the application at [http://localhost:4173](http://localhost:4173)

   The production build uses the same proxy configuration but serves the optimized static files instead of running the development server.

Note: The production build is what gets deployed to Docker and Kubernetes environments.

### 🐳 Docker Deployment

#### Quick Start with Pre-built Docker Image (Recommended)
If you want to try the application immediately, use the public image:
```sh
docker run -p 8080:80 claudiodeterminedai/onboarding-buddy:v0.0.7-alpha
```
Then access [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

#### Build and Run Your Own Image
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/onboarding-buddy.git
   cd onboarding-buddy
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. (Optional) Build the frontend manually (advanced):
   ```sh
   npm run build        # Production build
   npm run build:dev    # Development build
   ```

4. Build the Docker image:
   ```sh
   docker build -t your-registry/onboarding-buddy:<tag> .
   ```

5. Push to container registry (optional):
   ```sh
   docker push your-registry/onboarding-buddy:<tag>
   ```

6. Run the container:
   ```sh
   docker run -p 8080:80 your-registry/onboarding-buddy:<tag>
   ```

7. Access the application at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

### ☸️ HPE PCAI Deployment

The application is designed to be deployed on HPE's Private Cloud AI (PCAI) using AIE's Import Framework feature. The provided Helm chart simplifies the deployment process and includes all necessary Kubernetes resources.

1. **(Optional) Create a Kubernetes secret** containing your API key:
   For enhanced security, you can store your API key in a Kubernetes secret instead of including it directly in your values file. Here's how to create and use a secret:

   ```sh
   # Create a generic secret with your API key
   kubectl create secret generic onboarding-buddy-secrets \
     --from-literal=apiKey='your-actual-api-key-here' \
     -n <target-namespace>
   ```
   
   Replace:
   - `onboarding-buddy-secrets` with your desired secret name (must match the name in values.yaml)
   - `apiKey` with the key name that matches your configuration
   - `<target-namespace>` with the namespace where you'll deploy the application

   Verify the secret was created:
   ```sh
   kubectl get secret onboarding-buddy-secrets -n <target-namespace> -o yaml
   ```

   **Security Best Practices**
   - Never commit API keys to version control
   - Use Kubernetes RBAC to restrict access to secrets
   - Consider using a secret management solution like HashiCorp Vault for production environments
   - Rotate API keys regularly and update the corresponding secrets

2. **Prepare your configuration**:
   Create a `values.yaml` file with your configuration:
   ```yaml
   # values.yaml
   
   # Image configuration
   image:
     repository: claudiodeterminedai/onboarding-buddy
     tag: v0.0.7-alpha
     pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
   
   # Replica count for high availability
   replicaCount: 1
   
   # Resource requests and limits
   resources:
     requests:
       cpu: "100m"
       memory: "256Mi"
     limits:
       cpu: "500m"
       memory: "1Gi"
   
   # AI Configuration
   ai:
     # AI endpoint URL (e.g., https://your-llm-endpoint.com)
     endpoint: "https://your-llm-endpoint.com"
     # AI model to use
     model: "Meta/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct"
     # Additional AI configuration parameters
     config:
       temperature: 0.7
       maxTokens: 2000
     # API Key configuration
     apiKey:
      # Option 1: Directly specify the API key (not recommended for production)
      # value: "your-api-key-here"
     
      # Option 2: Reference a Kubernetes secret (recommended)
      secret:
        name: "onboarding-buddy-secrets"  # Name of the Kubernetes secret
        key: "apiKey"  # Key within the secret that contains the API key
   
   # Istio Virtual Service Configuration
   ezua:
     virtualService:
       endpoint: "onboarding-buddy.${DOMAIN_NAME}"
       istioGateway: "istio-system/ezaf-gateway"
   ```

3. **Package the Helm chart**:
   ```sh
