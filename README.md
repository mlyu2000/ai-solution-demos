# HPE Private Cloud AI

##  AI Solution Use Case Demos

This repository contains use case demos developed for Private Cloud AI (PCAI). 

The most generic, vertical-agnostic demos, implementing some of the most recurrent use cases are found are the root level of this repo. 
These are the following:

| Demo                                                          | Short Description          |
| --------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| [Basic Agent Langflow](basic-agent-langflow)              | A **Langflow** setup defining a basic agentic flow to answer questions requiring informations from both local files, using RAG, and data from a SQL database. Relies on **MLIS** for model deployment. **MCP server** usage optional.           |
| [Base Code Assistant - Opencode](basic-code-assistant-opencode)                          | An explanation on how to setup and use **Opencode**, an open source AI coding agent, in a **VS Code server**, leveraging models deployed using **MLIS**.            |
| [Conversation Toolbox](conversation-toolbox-demo)                          | A custom web application connecting to a chat model, an ASR model and Fish Audio S2 pro TTS model, deployed using **MLIS**, to provide a multilingual AI voice assistant, as well as file transcriptions capabilities. Voice Assistant accepts connections to **MCP servers** to enrich its capabilities.           |
| [Finetune Tool Calling LLM](finetune-tool-calling-llm)                | **Notebooks**, using **Nemo microservices** to fine-tune an LLM to improve its tool-calling capabilities.           |
| [Image Generation - ComfyUI](image-generation-comfyui)                | An explanation of how to simply use **ComfyUI**, an AI creation engine enabling powerful media creation AI workflows, such as, but not limited to **image generation**, **image editing** and **video generation**.|
| [Image Segmentation](image-segmentation)                      | Python scripts to fine-tune CNNs for segmentation tasks on provided datasets, expected to be executed in a **Jupyter notebook**, with experiment tracking on **MLflow**. Also includes a streamlit application to display segmentation results from any checkpoint saved, on any dataset image.           |
| [Multimodal RAG](multimodal-rag)                        | An advanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) flow, supporting multiple files modalities, including text, images, audio and video, coming with its own **MCP server** to easily reuse this RAG flow elsewhere. Includes steps on how to use it with **Open WebUI** and **Opencode**.           |
| [NL to SQL](nl-to-sql)                        | An **Open WebUI** setup to allow chatting with SQL data, leveraging tools from an **MCP server** to interact with data from a Postgres database. Relies on **MLIS** for model deployment.           |
| [Object Detection - YOLO](object-detection-yolo)                        | A simple **streamlit application** running object detection inference using a **YOLO model** on images and videos it takes as input.           |
| [Offline Meeting Transcription](offline-meeting-transcription)                | A transcription pipeline converting raw audio recordings into speaker-attributed transcripts and structured meeting minutes, using Whisper (for ASR, deployed on **MLIS**) and **Pyannote** (for speaker diarization) connected to **Open WebUI**.|
| [Realtime Live Voice Translation](realtime-live-voice-translation)                | A custom web application that captures the user's voice and provides transcription and translation in real time. Relies on Whisper ASR model and a generic LLM deployed on **MLIS**.|
| [Text Document Analysis](text-document-analysis)                | A simple web application in which users can upload text and PDF files, ask or upload a list of questions and get answers for each document in an Excel sheet, after document analysis leveraging an LLM deployed using **MLIS**.           |
| [Vision Analytics](vision-analytics)                        | A Gradio application using a VLM to analyze images, videos and/or streams. Files can be uploaded from the UI, or read from the filesystem. Relies on **MLIS** for model deployment.           |

The remaining demos are split between two folders:
- **Vertical_demos**: Demos bound to a specific vertical, or which require provided data to be run (not runnable with your own data).
- **Archived_demos**: Outdated demos that we no longer support and/or miscelleanous demos that do not fit into the other categories.

## Upcoming changes

The following demos will be updated:
- **Finetune Tool Calling LLM**

New demos are being considered:
- **Model Monitoring**
- **RAG**
