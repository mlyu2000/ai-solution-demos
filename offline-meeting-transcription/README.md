## Abstract

Organizations generate vast amounts of audio from meetings, court hearings, compliance calls, and interviews — yet most of this content remains unstructured and inaccessible. Manual transcription is slow, expensive, and struggles with multi-speaker attribution. This demo shows how open-source AI models can be assembled into a complete offline transcription pipeline on HPE Private Cloud AI, converting raw audio recordings into speaker-attributed transcripts and structured meeting minutes — entirely on-premises.

The pipeline combines two AI capabilities: speech-to-text (OpenAI Whisper large-v3-turbo), and speaker diarization (pyannote.audio community-1). These are deployed as independent, reusable services on PCAI and connected through a single chat-based interface via OpenWebUI.

- Accelerates meeting documentation from hours of manual work to minutes of automated processing
- Provides speaker-attributed transcripts 
- Keeps all audio data on-premises — no external API calls, suitable for legal, compliance, and government use cases

Features:
- Upload audio files (.wav, .mp3, .m4a, .ogg, .flac) via a simple chat interface and receive diarized transcripts
- Automatic speaker detection supporting 2–10+ speakers with configurable min/max speaker hints
- 99-language support via Whisper large-v3-turbo with ~6x speed improvement over large-v3
- Microservice architecture: speech model, diarization, and orchestration are independently scalable and swappable
- Whisper model served through HPE MLIS for shared, multi-tenant GPU utilization
- Diarization runs on CPU, minimizing GPU requirements

## Description

### Overview

This demo deploys four components on PCAI that together form an end-to-end offline audio transcription pipeline:

| Component | Role | GPU | Source |
|-----------|------|-----|--------|
| **Open WebUI** | Chat-based user interface for file upload, transcript display, and LLM interaction | No | [ai-solution-eng/frameworks/open-webui](https://github.com/ai-solution-eng/frameworks/tree/main/open-webui) |
| **WhisperX-FastAPI** | Orchestrator — coordinates transcription, diarization, and word-level alignment | No (MLIS mode) | [pavelzbornik/whisperX-FastAPI](https://github.com/pavelzbornik/whisperX-FastAPI), ported to PCAI |
| **Pyannote Diarization** | Standalone speaker diarization service (who spoke when) | No (CPU) | Custom image `caovd/pyannote-diarization:0.1.1`, ported to PCAI |
| **Whisper large-v3-turbo** | Speech-to-text model served via HPE MLIS | Yes (1x GPU) | Deployed through MLIS model catalog |

### Workflow

**Step 1 — Audio Upload:** The user opens Open WebUI, starts a chat, and attaches a meeting audio recording (.wav, .mp3, etc.). A community WhisperX Pipe plugin installed in Open WebUI detects the audio file and routes it to WhisperX-FastAPI.

**Step 2 — Transcription:** WhisperX-FastAPI receives the audio and sends it to the Whisper large-v3-turbo model hosted on HPE MLIS. The model returns a raw text transcription of the audio.

**Step 3 — Speaker Diarization:** Simultaneously, WhisperX-FastAPI sends the same audio to the Pyannote Diarization service. Pyannote analyzes vocal patterns and returns time-stamped speaker segments (e.g., `SPEAKER_00: 0.20s → 4.80s`).

**Step 4 — Alignment & Combination:** WhisperX-FastAPI performs word-level forced alignment locally (using wav2vec2) to produce precise per-word timestamps. It then combines the transcription with the diarization output, assigning a speaker label to every word.

**Step 5 — Transcript Display:** The diarized transcript — with speaker labels, timestamps, and full text — is returned to Open WebUI and displayed in the chat.


**Data flow summary:** Audio file → Open WebUI → WhisperX-FastAPI → (Whisper MLIS + Pyannote service) → diarized transcript → Open WebUI. All data remains within the PCAI cluster.

## Running the demo

### Demo 1: Audio Transcription with Speaker Diarization

This demo shows the core pipeline — uploading an audio file and receiving a speaker-attributed transcript.

1. Open Open WebUI and start a new chat
2. In the model selector, choose the **whisperx_pipe** function
3. Click the attachment button (📎) and upload a meeting audio file (.wav or .mp3, 1–5 minutes, 2–3 speakers)
4. Type `"Transcribe this meeting"` and send
5. When prompted about multiple speakers, click **Confirm**
6. Wait for processing (typically 20–60 seconds depending on audio length)
7. The diarized transcript appears in the chat with speaker labels (`SPEAKER_00`, `SPEAKER_01`) and timestamps

**Expected output:**
```
SPEAKER_00 [00:03 - 00:04]: Let me ask you about AI.
SPEAKER_00 [00:04 - 00:11]: It seems like this year for the entirety of
the human civilization is an interesting year for the development of
artificial intelligence.
SPEAKER_01 [00:39 - 00:49]: I think you're right, first of all, that in
the last year, there have been a bunch of advances on scaling up these
large transformer models.
```

## Limitations

**Speaker diarization accuracy:** Open-source diarization (pyannote community-1) achieves 11–20% Diarization Error Rate on clean audio with 2–3 speakers. Accuracy degrades with distant microphones, overlapping speech, similar-sounding voices, or 5+ speakers. For a controlled demo, use clean recordings with clear turn-taking.

**Speaker labels are generic:** The system produces labels like `SPEAKER_00`, `SPEAKER_01` — not real names. Mapping labels to actual speaker names requires voice enrollment, which is not implemented.

**Offline only:** This demo processes completed audio recordings. Real-time / live transcription is not supported — it requires a streaming ASR architecture which is a different technical approach.

**Audio quality dependency:** Transcription quality depends heavily on the input audio. Background noise, echo, low bitrate, or heavy compression will reduce accuracy. Best results come from close-mic or headset recordings.

**Single language per recording:** Whisper large-v3-turbo supports 99 languages but assumes a single language per audio file. Mixed-language recordings (code-switching) may produce inconsistent results.

**Open WebUI audio upload:** The WhisperX Pipe handles audio file detection via file extension. If Open WebUI rejects an audio file upload, rename the file to `.wav` or `.mp3`. The built-in mic button in Open WebUI is for dictation (voice-to-text input), not for recording meetings.
